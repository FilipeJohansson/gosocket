# GoSocket

A simple WebSocket abstraction for Go that gets you up and running in minutes.

## Why GoSocket?

Setting up WebSocket servers in Go usually means writing a lot of boilerplate code. You need to handle connections, manage clients, implement broadcasting, deal with rooms, and handle different message formats. GoSocket abstracts all of this away.

## What GoSocket will be

- **Simple setup**: Install package, write 5-10 lines of code, have a working WebSocket server
- **Multiple encoding support**: JSON, Protobuf, MessagePack, or raw binary data
- **Built-in rooms**: Join/leave rooms without manual management  
- **Broadcasting**: Send to all clients, specific rooms, or individual clients
- **Middleware support**: Add auth, logging, CORS, whatever you need
- **Graceful shutdown**: Clean connection handling when stopping
- **Multiple servers**: Run different WebSocket servers on different ports easily

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is in early development, some API structure is defined but methods are not implemented yet.
If you're interested in contributing, or want to follow progress, watch this repository.

## Planned API

```go
// Basic server
ws := gosocket.New().
    WithPort(8080).
    WithPath("/ws").
    OnConnect(func(client *gosocket.Client) {
        fmt.Printf("Client connected: %s\n", client.ID)
    }).
    OnMessage(func(client *gosocket.Client, message *gosocket.Message) {
        // Echo message to all clients
        ws.Broadcast(message.RawData)
    })

// Start server (blocking)
ws.Start()
```

```go
// Advanced usage with rooms and JSON
ws := gosocket.New().
    WithPort(8080).
    WithJSONSerializer().
    OnConnect(func(client *gosocket.Client) {
        client.JoinRoom("general")
    }).
    OnJSONMessage(func(client *gosocket.Client, data interface{}) {
        // Broadcast JSON to room
        ws.BroadcastToRoomJSON("general", data)
    })

go ws.Start()
```
